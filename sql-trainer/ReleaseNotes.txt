b2) OR: A (possibly locally installed) MySQL server with training data is available.

Starting the Application:
- Unzip the archive (if software was delivered as zip).
- Make sure, that SQLTrainer.jar is placed in same folder as sql-trainer-config.

Customisation:
Training data and the used database server can be changed easily without modifying the code.
Just edit file static-properties.xml (the static-properties-xy.xml files provide examples)
and add new files into the dbinfo directory following the obvious name conventions.

Setting up a development environment:
See wiki documents.
